SpellCastSounds is a WoW AddOn that plays a random sound when you cast certain spells.

You can configure the spells and sounds at the top of `core.lua`.

This was written for [Punchies](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/moon-guard/Punchies/) as an example of how WoW AddOns are written. See [this thread](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10092379212) for details.

To install the AddOn from GitHub, click the "Download ZIP" button and decompress the downloaded ZIP. Make a new folder called `SpellCastSounds` in your `WoW\Interface\AddOns` directory and move the TOC and Lua files into it. Restart your WoW client to load the AddOn.
