SpellCastSounds is a WoW AddOn that plays a random sound when you cast certain spells.

You can configure the spells and sounds at the top of `core.lua`.

This was written for [Punchies](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/moon-guard/Punchies/) as an example of how WoW AddOns are written. See [this thread](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10092379212) for details.
